Referring IMDB Movies Database Dump

This database contains many movie titles with their release year and their “rank” on imdb. 
An extra table contains information about movie genres (why do you think another table is needed to store this information?). 
It also contains tables with the actors and directors for each title, and their gender. 
Finally, there is a table that contains the most common genre for each director, and another table that contains information about the role each actor played in a movie.
