# Numbers and Strings

In Python, like any other programming language and life in general, we _do things_ with _stuff_. Most of this course will focus on the things we do and how to do them. But today we will talk about the stuff.

Almost everything in Python is an object. We will deal with numbers, text, lists, dictionaries... all of these things are different types of Python objects.

The type of an object defines what can you do with it, and how will it behave. For example, you can add two numbers together, and as long as they are a type of python number, they will behave just as in maths: you will receive the product of the two numbers
"""

2 + 2

"""But if you try to sum two strings, the behaviour will be different:"""

"2" + "2"

"""Any object in Python can be assigned to a variable with the `=` operator. Variables are just names for objects - they're nicknames that allow us to identify or call our objects."""

result = 4 + 3

"""At any point, we can retrieve whatever we stored in a variable by using its name:"""

# https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/py/python-print.html

print(result)

"""If we want to find out what type of object a variable is, we can ask it with the function `type()`, like this:"""

# https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/type

type(result)

"""###### **Exercise 1:**
add `100` and `3.4`. Assign it to the variable `addition`. Print the type of that variable.
"""

# your code here
addition = 100+3.4
print ("The answer is:", float(addition))

"""## Booleans

The values `True` and `False` are special in Python. They are called "booleans".
"""

type(True)

type(False)

"""If you try to use mathematical operations with booleans, will see how `True` equates to `1` and `False` equates to `0`

"""

True + True

False + False

"""## Integers

Integers are whole numbers (without fractions or decimal points) that can be positive or negative.
"""

type(-8)

"""You can use mathmatical operators with integers (and floats):

- `+` Addition
- `-` Substraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Floating-point division
- `//` Truncating division
- `%` Modulus
- `**` Exponentiation

###### **Exercise 2:**
assign the number corresponding to the present year to the variable `year` and your age to the variable `age`. Operate with both variables to create a new variable called `birth_year`.
"""

# your code here
year = 2022
age = 39
birth_year = year - age

"""You can update the value of a variable like this:"""

age = 30
age = age + 1
print(age)

"""Or you can get the same output by combining both arithmetic operators like this:"""

age = 30
age += 1
print(age)

"""The same holds for other mathmatical operators

###### **Exercise 3:**
create a variable called `price` with the value `100`. Then update its value in a single line by multiplying it by `2`.

Floats are numbers with decimal places

"""## Text Strings

You will use text just as much as numbers when programming. Strings are created with either single quotes `'` or double quotes `"`:

"""There are many more string methods in Python. Browse through them here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp 

About 99.9% of the time, coding does not mean memorizing functions and knowing them off by heart, but being quick in finding the function you need, discovering how to use them, reading the documentation, or simply adapting coding examples from the internet to meet your needs. 

In the exercises below, you will have to use several Python string methods, in combination with what you've learned here. Use the link from _w3schools_ or Google around to complete them.

###### **Exercise 8:**
create a Python string with the following text, and assign it to the variable `data_science`:

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. 

Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data. Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.

convert all of `data_science` to lower case.

"""## Formatting with f-strings

Strings can be concatenated with `+`. Sometimes, you need to [_interpolate_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) values into strings. 

Say you work for a logistics company and have a script that calculates the number of trucks that should be made ready for the next day. You want this number to be included in the sentence of an email: `"For tomorrow, we will need x trucks."` But replacing x with the number of trucks, which will vary each day.

This task is known as formatting strings. It can be confusing to learn this by just browsing the internet because there are many ways to format strings in Python: the old one (using `%`), the new one (using `{}`and `format()`) and the newest one (using `f-strings`).

We will only show you how to use f-strings, but be ready to stumble into the other ones at any time!
"""

n_trucks = 73

email = f"For tomorrow, we will need {n_trucks} trucks."

"""The curly brackets support expressions like these:"""

place = "main garage"

email = f"For tomorrow, we will need {n_trucks+10} trucks in the {place.title()}."

print(email)

"""###### **Exercise 15:**
convert the `data_science` string from the previous exercise into an f-string, replacing the name "Jim Gray" with the variable `jim`:
