RFE might be able to detect valuable non-linear interactions between several features.\n","\n","> A quick note about `get_feature_names_out()`: when you see methods like this one in a pre-made notebook, it might seem like you just \"had to know\" them. But that's not true! What you have to know is that Scikit-Learn transformer objects tend to keep valuable information in them after they were fitted. If you want to get this information, always look in the documentation for available attributes and methods, and scan for whatever you need.

This will allow you to use this transfomer with a particular model (e.g. a Decision Tree) just for feature selection, but then try other models (e.g. a KNN) in your pipeline.\n","\n","In `SelectFromModel` you can also play with the `threshold` parameter to keep a higher or lower number of features. This parameter is different from the `K` in `SelectKBest` in that you don't pass it the number of features to keep, but the lowest score a feature must have (in the \"feature importances\" ranking) to be included. Since these scores are abstract, it is difficult to come up with the right number without previous exploration or tuning.
